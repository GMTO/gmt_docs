<p>The GMT data archiving system (DAS) manages, stores, and distributes all data
products related to the operations of the observatory. The SWCS requirements as
derived from the System Level are shown in Table 10-41. All the data in the DAS
are maintained on-site at the observatory for operations, and are backed up in
at least one off-site location.</p>

<p>The GMT DAS architecture is based on the client-server model where a server
maintains the data, manages their access, and performs processing needed to
complete requests, while clients make requests to the server to access the
archive for searching, retrieving, updating, deleting, or ingesting data. The
DAS is comprised of forward server, global server, trending server, and backup
server. The different servers have the following roles:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><em>Forward Server</em> – The forward server manages the Phase I and Phase II
telescope proposal preparations by astronomers and the TAC process,
including exposure time calculations/simulations, proposal submission,
observing design and specification, and proposal management.</li>
<li><em>Global Server</em> – Residing at the core, the global server has general and
unrestricted access to data stored in the GMT data archive. The role of the
global server is to manage transactions between different severs and the
users. Access to the servers from the outside world is via clients that will
have varying degrees of access to the database, depending on permission
levels.</li>
<li><em>Trending Server</em> – The trending server organizes time-series data in the
archive so that observatory applications can use the data to easily monitor,
diagnose or improve performance behavior.</li>
<li><em>Backup Server</em> – The backup server provides the capability to create
copies of the archived data to guarantee their integrity.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The DAS will store all operations data, including but not limited to: science,
engineering, facility and environmental repositories, which are discussed below.
Each type of data has a storage duration defined by the SLR, and based on
operation needs. Essential engineering and science data will exist for the
lifetime of the observatory (50 years), while for non-essential data the
duration may vary. However, it is a goal to provide permanent storage for all
engineering data, if feasible and cost effective. The DAS collections include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Science</strong> – Required by SCI-1130, the operational data archive stores any
information produced in direct support of science observations that are
applied to science data frames, affect their photometric calibrations,
provide information about the observations, or facilitate the observing
process. These include calibration images (biases, darks, flats), PSFs,
off-sky, standard stars, etc. Science data archive also contains observing
programs, such as proposals, observing setups, instrument configurations,
observing sequences, observing logs (generated both by users and
subsystems), exposure time simulations, etc. All science data are
proprietary up to a specified period of time. The science data archive
includes a custom area that will allow users to store observational
configurations that may be recalled or reused in future observing runs. User
archive collections can be defined as proprietary according to observatory
data distribution policies. The categories of science data are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Raw</em> – Raw data directly from the telescope instruments prior to any
manipulation or data rescaling. Raw data should have units that are the
basic counting units of the detector, i.e., usually [electrons] or
[electrons/ADU]. The images will have instrumental and observing artifacts
(cosmic rays, hot pixels, dead pixels, dead columns, non-uniform
illumination patterns) that have not been manipulated in any way.</p>
<p><em>Reduced</em> – Data processed through basic data reduction steps, including
bias, dark, etc., through the point of flatfielding, to account for primary
instrumental signatures. Reduced images should have a uniform special
illumination pattern, and corrections for pixel-to- pixel sensitivity
differences. For spectroscopy, this entails linearizing the data in
wavelength, spatially on detectors, and flux corrections.</p>
<p><em>Combined</em> – Multiple sub-exposures of the same observational block, or
unit, are combined in an optimal way for the purpose of increasing the
signal-to-noise; removing cosmic-rays, saturation, bad pixels, etc. For IFU
data, this involves transforming 2-D spectra into a 3-D data cube. This may
include mosaic combinations, if doing so is necessary for removing
instrumental signatures.</p>
<p><em>Calibrated</em> – Places combined and/or reduced images onto a flux calibrated
scale, using standard star observations.</p>
<p><em>High level</em> – High-level data products include everything beyond
calibration, and may be specified by the observer. Examples of high level
data products are mosaic combinations, object or spectral feature
extraction, data analysis, etc.</p>
<p><em>Observing Programs</em> – Observing programs include Phase I science
proposals, Phase II observation and instrument definitions, and instrument
configuration setups.</p>
<p><em>Sequences</em> – Observatory-wide sequences of the observations that a user
may use and modify.</p>
<p><em>Pipeline Parameters</em> – Observatory-wide parameters used for data or
activity pipelines. Scripts: Observatory-wide scripts used for data
reduction, analysis, or other purposes.</p>
<p><em>Logs</em> – Observing and user logs. Observing logs have the same proprietary
status as the parent data with which they are associated.</p>
<p><em>User Archive</em> – User archive stores information about the users, such as
their contact information, affiliation, proposals, etc. A user archive can
also store observing notes, templates, scripts, pipeline parameters, data
and models generated from exposure time calculations, and observing
sequences that she/he may find useful to recall for future observations. The
user archive is proprietary and can only be accessed by users and
observatory personnel with correct permission settings. However, the archive
can be shared between different users/visitors to allow collaboration when
the owner grants appropriate permissions.</p>
<p><em>Documentation</em> – Instruction manuals for carrying out science
observations, including: data taking, archival access, remote observing,
user interfaces, observing procedures, instrument</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Engineering</strong> – Engineering data archive stores information relevant to
operation and maintenance of hardware and software. Engineering data
originate from the telescope, science instruments, and other mechanical and
electrical systems in the observatory, operating, and supporting facilities.
Examples of engineering data include: telemetry, health status, logs,
technical manuals, schematics, and other data from the telescope subsystems,
science instruments, devices, etc. The broad category of engineering data
includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Runtime Data</em> – During runtime operations, the telescope and instruments
generate telemetry, detector, and sensor information that are continuously
and automatically monitored. In particular, telemetry data refers to all
information that has time stamps. Examples of telemetry data include
telescope motor encoder positions; instrument shutter status; filter wheel
position status; AGWS correction rates; interlock and safety states;
atmospheric seeing, etc. The health and performance of most devices and
subsystems are monitored without human knowledge or participation. The
process involves performing automatic analysis, generating operating
statistics, and finally filtering the information for human operators to
interpret. All raw and processed runtime data are stored in the
engineering data archive.</p>
<p><em>Configuration Data</em> – Configuration data are critical to the correct
operation of the observatory. Configuration data include site information
(elevation, longitude, latitude, etc.), lookup tables for telescope
pointing, flexure models, coordinate transform matrices, geometric
correction and transformation parameters, etc. It also includes:
operational presets that are loaded into all telescope systems for
initialization upon start-up, resets, or to change configurations during
runtime operations; default parameters used by instruments, calibration
pipelines, and sequences.</p>
<p><em>Logs</em> – Engineering logs are reports entered by observatory staff
(technical report, nightly reports, maintenance logs, etc.) or generated
automatically by the telescope or instruments in the course of operations
(nightly observational summary report, health status of all subsystems,
devices, and components, errors). Observing logs are reported by observers
and telescope operators that summarize the data that were obtained each
night.</p>
<p><em>Documentation</em> – Engineering documentation archive stores manuals,
technical schematics, engineering notes, for all observatory components
such as electronics, mechanical parts, devices, sensors, detectors,
motors, etc.</p>
<p><em>Software</em> – Software (code, scripts) that are both contributed by users
for high level analysis or operations, and native to observatory
operations are stored in the engineering archive.</p>
<p><em>Hardware</em> – Hardware data include the health and status of the
telescope, AO, all the subsystems, computers, environmental sensors,
exhaust fans, communication network, observatory alarm systems, building
and environmental sensors, system logs, etc. For environmental sensors,
their status and health are part of facility hardware data, whereas the
sensor readouts, e.g., temperature, wind speed, earthquake magnitude, and
other weather-related data, are classified as environmental data.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Facility and Environment Data</strong> Facility and environment data support the
operation of the telescope by monitoring the environment in which the
telescope operates. Environmental data help to inform safety and enable the
facility to cope with changing conditions (winds, clouds), and make
decisions on the observing modes (AO, natural seeing). The data measure the
conditions both in and outside of the telescope and facility enclosure. The
categories of Facility environment data include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Weather</em> – Cloud coverage, wind speed and direction, humidity,
temperature, pressure, rain condition. Some of the information is obtained
from the national weather service stations.</p>
<p><em>Atmospheric</em> – Turbulence: The OCD calls for monitoring of the
atmospheric turbulence and seeing which may be monitored by a
scintillation sensor.</p>
<p><em>Seismic</em> – Earthquake</p>
<p><em>Ambient</em> – Enclosure temperature, wind speed and direction, precipitable
water vapor, dust level, sky brightness</p>
