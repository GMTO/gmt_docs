Computing Platform
------------------

Device Control Subsystems are deployed in standardized GMT Device Control
Computers (DCCs), while general processing components are deployed in Data
Processing Computers (DPCs).

Two types of DCCs are supported: Intel Industrial Computers (PCs) running Linux
and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). In addition to the obvious benefits
of maintainability and cost-effectiveness, the use of standardized computer
architecture ensures that software components can adequately and robustly
compile and deploy on them.

PC based DCCs running Linux with real time extensions are used in the following
use cases:

  * The Device Control Subsystem has to be integrated with the low latency
    network.

  * High computing performance is required.

  * Complex operation scenarios.

PLCs are used in the following use cases:

  * The bandwidth necessary for telemetry is low.

  * Simple supervision, coordination or operation scenarios.

*Computer Hardware*
...................

The current baseline consists of standard off-the-shelf data center class
computers. The Table below presents the characteristics of the computer platform.
The interface with field devices is done using EtherCAT, a real-time Ethernet
based fieldbus, which only requires the availability of standard network
ports.  This is in contrast with backplane-based systems (e.g., VME, PXI)
where the field interface is implemented with cards connected to the
backplane. The Section on :ref:`field_device_interface` describes with more
detail the characteristics of EtherCAT. The fact that modern motor drivers
include embedded motion controllers and even some local logic by means of a
PLC reduces the performance requirements on the computing platform. As a
consequence computers can be very compact. Data center class computers are
used to improve system reliability (e.g., redundant power supplies). This
configuration has been used during prototyping activities. The physical and
power consumption envelope of these computers will be optimized once the
project approaches its deployment phase.

Some of the computer components are optional as their use depends on the
functions performed by the software components deployed in them. For example,
DCCs require access to the fieldbus, but many of them do not require access to
the low latency network. DPCs do not require access to the fieldbus, but require
high capacity storage for quick processing of intermediate results.

The figure below provides the description of the two control subsystem
deployment architectures. The choice between one over the other is part of the
TCS architecture design process and will be analyzed in a case-by-case basis
during detailed design. Examples of the Single Tier Control configuration are
the Mount Control System or the M1 Control System. The Enclosure Control System
follows the Two Tier Control design as it fits the capabilities of the
industrial companies that may procure the low-level control system integrated
with the rest of the enclosure.

*PLCs*
......

Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs, PACs and Soft PLCs) are used in several
specific areas, as in the case of the Enclosure for rotating the dome and
commanding shutters and wind vents. PLCs are required to use the IEC 61131-3
[IEC61131-3]_ programming standard widely adopted in industry. This part of
IEC 61131 specifies the syntax and semantics of a unified suite of programming
languages for programmable controllers. These consist of two textual
languages: Instruction List and Structured Text, and two graphical languages:
Ladder Diagram and Function Block Diagram. Also, Sequential Function Chart
elements are defined for structuring the internal organization of programmable
controller programs and function blocks [IEC61131-3]_.

Programmable controllers are integrated with the rest of the Observatory using
the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) communications standard [Soto13]_.  `OPC
UA <http://www.opcfoundation.org/about/what-is-opc>`_
is the next generation OPC standard that provides a cohesive, secure and
reliable cross platform framework for access to real time and historical data
and events.

PLCopen provides another important programming solution to the wide range of
selectable motion control hardware available. PLCopen motion standard provides
a way to have standard application libraries that are reusable for multiple
hardware platforms. This lowers development, maintenance, and support costs
while eliminating confusion. Standardization comes about by defining libraries
of reusable components so that the programming is less hardware dependent,
increasing the reusability of the application software, and enabling the
application to scale across different control solutions (see `plcopen.org
<http://www.plcopen.org/>`_).

Currently the suite of PLCopen Motion Control Specifications consists of 6
parts, of which GMT will adopt Part 1: `Function Blocks for Motion Control
<http://www.plcopen.org/pages/tc2_motion_control/>`_.

A Soft PLC is a control software engine that runs on standard CPUs such as
Intel, ARM, PowerPC, etc. Combining the features of a PLC (such as I/O control,
PID, ladder logic, standard industrial communication protocols) with the power
of computers (e.g., data handling, logging, running multiple applications
simultaneously, communications over standard networks, user functions, database
interfaces) a Soft PLC provides the most comprehensive industrial control
solution on the market. The GMTâ€™s preferred choice for soft PLC is the TwinCAT
PLC automation software. TwinCAT PLC engine runs on a standard PC/IPC hardware.
It has a real-time kernel with a cycle time typically on the order of
microseconds, with a choice of fieldbus including EtherCAT. TwinCAT PLC offers
all the languages in the IEC 61131-3 standard and has a powerful development
environment for programs whose code size and data regions far exceed the
capacities of conventional PLC systems.


*Operating Systems*
...................

Low-latency, deterministic, system performance is required for real-time control
and signal processing applications that must respond to external events in a
predictable manner, independently of other considerations and particularly the
workload. Furthermore, low jitter operation of the fieldbus master is required
for some elaborate control loops (e.g., multi-axis interpolation) and for high
rate, low jitter, telemetry sampling. For those reasons, digital or motion
control applications are often built on top of a real-time operating system that
specially addresses:

  * concurrent, multi-tasking applications

  * task scheduling and priority policies

  * deterministic, low latency responses

  * interfaces to hardware

Several benchmarks [Bec12b]_ and tests have been performed in order to assess the
adequacy of several Linux real-time extensions. The Linux kernel / GNU-Linux
operating system has a long track record of reliability for server and embedded
systems, and excellent soft real-time performance. RT_PREEMPT is very flexible
and actively developed, and has the performance needed for all control systems
requirements considered so far.

A typical control loop requires periodic execution at a predefined rate. Linux
offers different kinds of timers, depending on hardware availability. The High
Resolution Timers introduced in kernel 2.6 provide nanosecond resolution. The
next two Figures show the results of some of the tests performed. The tests
include also the performance of the EtherCAT master stack.

.. figure:: _static/hi-res-timer-benchmark-2kHz.png

   High Resolution Timer Benchmark @ 2KHz

The above Figure shows a high resolution timer benchmark at 2KHz. In this
benchmark, a callback is scheduled to run every 500 microseconds, generating a
square waveform using a digital output channel on the host. The waveform is
captured on an oscilloscope where timing accuracy and jitter are measured.

.. figure:: _static/hi-res-timer-benchmark-8kHz.png

   High Resolution Timer Benchmark with 3.5 Million Samples @ 8 kHz

The above Figure shows a high-resolution timer benchmark now at 8 kHz. A callback
is scheduled to run every 125 microsecond. The blue curve shows the waveform.
The oscilloscope triggers on the rising edge; the green curve can be ignored as
EtherCAT response was being tested in parallel. Over 3.5 million samples
collected, the signal shows a (static) clock skew of 330 nanoseconds (125.00 -
124.670), maximum jitter of 29 microseconds with 517 nanoseconds rms.
