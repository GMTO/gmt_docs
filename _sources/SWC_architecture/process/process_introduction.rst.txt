=======

This section presents an overview of the engineering and management process used
in the development of the Software and Controls System. The GMT development
process defines a set of practices that enforces the completeness, correctness,
robustness, and maintainability of the overall GMT software effort. It attempts
to reconcile the formality required by large multi-organization stage-gate
project with more recent software development practices that are more adaptive.
Recent software development practices improve productivity and quality, and
users generally benefit from a software systemâ€™s inherent ability to adapt, cost
effectively, rather than being formally set in stone.

The software development strategy for the GMT is determined by the interplay of
several factors:

  * The overall GMT process is based on a classical stage-gate model, where
    formal reviews are required before moving forward to subsequent phases of
    the project.  These reviews require formal documentation on design studies
    for all the subsystems and the application of system engineering practices.

  * External organizations, both partners and commercial vendors, are likely to
    develop software for the GMT. These organizations often work in multiple
    projects and often have their own optimized development processes, methods
    and tools. These organizations are distributed across several continents.

  * Software development is an experimental discipline in a continuous state of
    evolution. Agile development practices have consolidated in the last decade
    where working code is favored over documentation and code development starts
    very early in the project to facilitate requirements elicitation.

  * Several flavors of model-centric development are increasingly applied to
    both system and software engineering disciplines. Model driven development
    favors models over documentation, and models that can translate into code.

The following sections describe the practices and tools to be used in the
development of software by the GMTO project office: the formal approach to the
GMT software development, and how Agile techniques are applied to GMT to plan
and control the software development activities to improve the efficiency of the
formal process.  Model Driven Development (MDD) is employed to enforce design
consistency and to increase productivity.
