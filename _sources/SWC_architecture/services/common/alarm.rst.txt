*Alarm Service*
...............

The alarm system, along with the system supervisor and the Interlock & Safety
System (ISS), provide functions to assess and manage the overall health of the
system. Alarm events are triggered when an alarm condition is detected by a
Component (e.g., Controller or Supervisor). Alarm events are time-stamped and
include information on the component that has triggered the alarm.

The alarm system associates (using metadata) a set of actions with every alarm
event that has to be monitored manually or executed automatically. These
actions can include a reference to a workflow or sequence if one has been
defined.

Alarm conditions are part of the specification of a component, shown in the
following code-block.  When a fault condition occurs in a component, it is the
responsibility of that component to either handle the fault or to transmit
alarms up the supervisory chain until they reach a component that can address
the problem, or else eventually up to the operations staff.

**Service Capabilities**

  The Alarm System provides the following capabilities:

    * Notification of alarm events from any component in the system

    * Analysis of the stream of alarms to identify system health conditions

    * Filtering of alarms

    * Storage of alarm events

    * Visualization of the status of all the alarms in the system

    * Correlation via timestamp with any other event in the system

    * Logging operator acknowledgment.


**Service Packages**

  The implementation of the above capabilities is distributed to a set of
  packages:

    *Service Package (server & adapter)* -

      An alarm server system, deployed in several machines, takes care of
      receiving alarms, storing them and forwarding them to the alarm UI
      panels, or the alarm analysis system.

      In addition to the handling of alarm events, the alarm server provides
      features that allow managing of load balancing and fault tolerance. The
      alarm system operation, as with any other component, can be monitored by
      the telemetry system by specifying monitoring features in its interface
      (e.g., the number of components connected, the number of active alarms,
      state of the server, instant alarm throughput).

      The following alarm service block diagram shows how distributed
      components and supervisors access the Alarm Adapter interface to notify
      an alarm event. Adapters forward the alarm events to the alarm
      supervisor using push/pull sockets. Usually a single Alarm Adapter is
      deployed for all the components of a Subsystem that are collocated in
      the same computer.

  Alarm Service Block Diagram.  (1) The component detects an alarm event
  and invokes the *send_alarm* method inherited from the *BaseComponent*
  or *BaseSupervisor* classes. (2) The service adapter sends the alarm
  event to the supervisor using a push socket. The *Service supervisor*
  applies the business process rules associated with the alarm event if
  they are defined.  (3) The *Service supervisor* publishes the event to
  the subscribed components using a pub socket.

    *Analytics Package* -

      When an alarm is triggered, it may be useful to reconstruct the history and
      states of a subsystem surrounding that event. The analytics package allows
      for that possibility. The *analysis package* components run in real time
      streaming mode.

    *Visualization Package* -

      The visualization package provides custom panels that allow observatory
      operators to monitor and manage the alarms of the system. This is done
      implementing several optimize visualizations.

**Service Deployment**

  During operation, the alarm system components are deployed in different
  computers. A simple library is added to every component that allows the
  sending of alarm events. This is done via a simple API that doesnâ€™t expose
  any service details to the component.
