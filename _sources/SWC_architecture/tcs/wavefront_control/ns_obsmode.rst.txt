*Natural Seeing Observing Mode*
...............................

The simplest observing mode is natural seeing. A simplified control block
diagram of the Natural Seeing (NS) WFC is shown in the Figure below. Software
components associated with sensors are shown in orange, WFC components in grey,
and those associated with optical compensators in blue. Arrows indicate data
flow, color-coded by the type of data: Orange for WFC inputs, gray for internal
data flow between WFC components, and blue for WFC outputs. The WFC includes two
types of controllers: Wavefront controllers, which convert sensor measurements
to residual wavefront, and optics controllers which convert those wavefronts to
mechanical degrees of freedom.

    Natural Seeing wavefront control system simplified block diagram

The NS wavefront control functionality is split between two controllers: The NS
Fast Guiding controller and the Active Optics Wavefront Controller. The Active
Optics Wavefront Controller is common to all observing modes, though its
reconstructor matrix changes. It provides updates to the mount pointing, M1 and
M2 segment positioning, and M1 segment figure based on the wavefront slopes sent
by the AGWS Slope Processor, and optionally an On-Instrument Wavefront Sensor
(OIWFS, typically measuring tip-tilt or tip-tilt-focus). The NS Fast Guiding
Controller converts AGWS guider signal to fast tip-tilt commands for either the
FSM or ASM, and offloads the average FSM/ASM tilt to telescope pointing (not
shown).

**Overview**

    Four main control loops operate simultaneously in the natural seeing mode:

    A. The Slow Guiding control loop updates the pointing kernel guiding offsets
       based on low- pass filtered AGWS average wavefront tilt measurements.

    B. The Fast Guiding control loop updates the tip-tilt of the FSM (or ASM)
       based on full-rate AGWS segment tilt measurements.

    C. The Active Optics control loop updates the positions of the M1 and M2
       segments, and the figure of M1, based on AGWS wavefront sensor
       measurements.

    D. The Flexure control loop updates the position of the AGWS probes based on
       On- Instrument Wavefront Sensor measurements.


    The natural seeing mode fast and slow guiding control loops, and their
    expected performances, are described in detail in Section 6.12.3 [John13]_.
    The Active Optics control loop and its performance are detailed in Section
    6.12.2 [John13]_. In addition to these main feedback loops, there is also an
    offload between the fast guiding controller and the pointing kernel to avoid
    saturation of the FSM or ASM tip-tilt actuators.

**Component Descriptions**

    The Figure below shows a detailed block diagram of the natural seeing WFC,
    including all of the real-time software components currently envisioned.
    External components with interfaces to the WFC (e.g., sensor slope
    processors and mirror controllers) are also represented. Ports are
    identified with the input of output data type, and data flow with arrows.
    Telemetry is not explicitly shown, as it is provided as a system service to
    every component.

    A list of natural seeing WFC components is provided in Table 10-17. A
    description of the most critical components is given below, followed by an
    identification of the connections between them. Note that wavefront
    aberrations have been identified using the following nomenclature:

        * Global aberrations are defined over the full GMT pupil, while segment
          aberrations are defined over each segment.

        * System aberrations represent a measurement of the full telescope
          optical system, while M1, ASM, etc., aberrations represent only the
          contribution of one optical surface.

        * Temporal averages of an aberration are identified as aberration_av.

**AGWS Slope Processor**

    While the AGWS slope processor is not a component of the WFC, it is
    presented here for completeness. The AGWS slope processor converts the AGWS
    camera images into wavefront slopes, by computing the centroid of star or
    Shack-Hartmann spot images relative to reference pixel positions. The
    componentâ€™s input and output ports are listed in the Table below.

    There are four cameras in the AGWS. Each camera may be operated in one of
    four modes: Idle, Guide, TT7 and SH-WFS. The number of positions in the
    reference list will vary from 1 in Guide mode to 7 in TT7 mode, and ~576 in
    SH-WFS mode.  New images may be available as rapidly as 206 Hz in WFS mode,
    402 Hz in TT7 mode, and up to 2 kHz in Guide mode. The operating mode of the
    camera will control the output port to which its wavefront slopes are
    provided.

    Reference positions are provided by the Active Optics Reconstructor
    Server and may be modified by offsets provided by other components in the
    control system. For example, the AGWS Supervisor component might provide
    open loop calibration offsets dependent on the camera probe location and
    gravity vector, and the telescope control system might provide guide or
    other offsets to affect coordinated dithers or other tracking functions.

    In addition to full-rate centroid data, the AGWS slope processor will
    compute a low-pass filtered average wavefront tilt (from Guide, TT7, or
    WFS mode measurements) and provide this to the pointing kernel for slow
    guiding of the mount. Other parameters such as SNR, FWHM, and flux per
    subaperture will be computed for each camera and sent to the telemetry
    system. These values will be used by the Active Optics Reconstructor
    Server to correctly weight the measurements and verify pupil mapping.

**Fast Guiding Controller**

    The Fast Guiding Controller computes the segment tip-tilt commands that
    will be sent to either the FSM or ASM controller, depending on the M2
    assembly installed. Its data interfaces are listed in the following Table:

    In routine operation, the Fast Guiding Controller will close the servo
    control loop between the system segment tilt error measured by one AGWS
    probe in TT7 mode, and the absolute FSM or ASM segment tilt and piston
    commands. If no probe is configured in the TT7 mode, then global tilt
    measured by a probe in guide mode will be used. The Fast Guiding Controller
    must rotate the measured tilt error into the telescope coordinate system,
    and appropriately average measurements of multiple probes if several happen
    to be in TT7 or guide mode. This is done with a single matrix
    multiplication. Note that the low-pass filtered system global tilt error is
    simultaneously sent from the AGWS slope processor to the pointing kernel,
    and corrected at low bandwidth (~2 Hz) by the mount.

    The time average of the M2 segment tilt is also computed, and offloaded to
    M2 Positioner via the Active Optics Controller to avoid saturation of the
    FSM/ASM tilt actuators.

**Active Optics Wavefront Controller**

    The Active Optics Wavefront Controller maintains the alignment of the
    telescope and the figure of M1 and M2. The controller multiplies the vector
    of wavefront slopes measured by the three AGWS probes in WFS mode by a
    reconstructor matrix to compute the necessary corrections. The AGWS cameras
    in WFS mode will be synchronized, and will typically use 30 s integrations
    to average out atmospheric turbulence. The 319 error terms output by the
    matrix multiplication are summarized in Table 10-20. These are sent to the
    M1 and M2 optics controllers, as shown in Figure 10-22. The optics
    controllers enforce the stroke and force limits, and may therefore convert
    low-order bending modes into segment rigid body motion as required.

    GIR rotation error and differential probe position errors are determined by
    computing the average tip and tilt measured by each AGWS camera in WFS mode,
    and fitting these with a geometrical model. Any average rotation around the
    camera in Guide or TT7 mode is interpreted as a GIR rotation error, while
    the residual tip-tilt errors after the rotation is subtracted are
    interpreted as differential position errors of the WFS probes. GIR rotation
    error and differential probe position error are sent to the pointing kernel.

    A complete list of the Active Optics Wavefront Controller data interfaces is
    given in Table :numref:`aco_wfc_ports`. This component is common to all
    observing modes, but the reconstructor is different for each mode. The
    observing modes for which the ports are active are indicated in the last
    column.

**Active Optics Reconstructor Server**

    The Active Optics Reconstructor Server generates the reconstructor matrices
    for fast guiding and active optics correction. Each of these depends on the
    observing mode, the configuration of the AGWS probes, their positions in the
    DG focal plane, and the angle of the GIR. The componentâ€™s data interfaces
    are listed in :numref:`Table %s <aco_reconstructor_server_ports>`.

    The reconstructor matrix for fast guiding simply average and rotate
    wavefront slope vectors and can be computed analytically. The active optics
    reconstructor matrix is more complex, and the strategy followed to date (see
    Section 6.12.2.5 [John13]_) is to raytrace the spots of each Shack-Hartmann
    camera using Zemax. An unperturbed model of the telescope and AGWS wavefront
    sensors is first traced to provide reference spot positions. The model is
    then perturbed in each of the 319 degrees of freedom listed in
    :numref:`Table %s <aco_reconstructor_output_terms>`, and the difference
    between the centroids and their reference positions provides a column in the
    system matrix.  Finally, the reconstructor is computed by taking the
    pseudo-inverse of this system matrix.

    The reconstructor is dependent on each sensorâ€™s position and orientation in
    the telescope focal plane. Simulations have shown that when tracking near
    zenith, the matrix must be updated every ~15 seconds to avoid significant
    reduction in the delivered image quality due to the rapid rotation of the
    GIR [McLe13]_. Active optics updates may have to be interrupted during a
    transit near zenith when the pupil rotation rate exceeds 6 deg/min.

**Deployment**

    A representation of the deployment locations of the Natural Seeing WFC is
    provided in the Figure below.  All WFC software components run on standard
    rack-mounted servers in the Electronics Room of the Summit Support Building.
    All of these hardware components will be connected with both a low-latency
    Infiniband network and a standard Ethernet control network.  The wavefront
    sensor slope processors connect to their camera systems with various
    fiber-based camera protocols (e.g., CameraLink HS), allowing them to also be
    located in the Electronics Room.  Thus the only data connections onto the
    telescope are via fiber optics.
