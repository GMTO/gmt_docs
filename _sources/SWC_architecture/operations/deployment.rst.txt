Operations Deployment
---------------------

In order to provide flexibility in how the observatory operations are arranged
(e.g., the number and/or location of operations staff), and to evolve over time,
the Observatory Operations Subsystems, with the exception of the Sequencer, are
being designed to be deployable in a cloud- computing infrastructure. This
infrastructure can be provided by companies specialized in Platform as a Service
(PaaS) like Cloud Foundry, Amazon Web Services or Cloudera, or can be deployed
in the observatoryâ€™s own hardware. As this is an area that is rapidly evolving
it is advisable to conduct further study once the project is closer to
deployment and operation plans become more detailed.
