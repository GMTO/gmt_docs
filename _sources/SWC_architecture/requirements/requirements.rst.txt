Requirements Overview
---------------------

The GMT Observatory is an assembly of hardware and software subsystems that
operate in concert, under the control and coordination of the Software and
Control System (SWCS). Generally, the scope of the SWCS, as outlined in the
Operations Concept Document (OCD) [McCa13]_, is to:

  * Provide control of all observatory systems and subsystems.

  * Provide logic and intelligence to coordinate activities related to the
    operation of the observatory systems and subsystems.

  * Monitor the observatory to ensure proper operations, health and safety of
    the systems.

  * Enable and facilitate precise calibrations to ensure high data quality.

  * Maximize efficiency in observatory operations and runtime observing.

  * Provide software for observational planning and management, preparation, and
    observing.

  * Provide a common and consistent framework to develop software and hardware
    controls.

The SWCS Requirements [FiPe13]_ provide a framework for developing the SWCS to
meet the above goals, to flow down the specifications in the System Level
Requirements Document [Mait13]_ (SLRD) at Level 2, and to follow the operating
principles for the observatory outlined in the OCD [McCa13]_. They also ensure
proper verification of the SWCS during latter phases of the project. Overall,
the requirements for the SWCS are detailed in several documents that cover
Levels 3 to 5.

The Section on :ref:`document_tree_structure` gives an overview of the GMT
requirements document tree to provide a context for the organizational structure
used by the SWCS. Next, :ref:`level_3_SWCS_requirements` provides an overview of
SWCS Level 3 requirements and the document structures associated with each
level.
