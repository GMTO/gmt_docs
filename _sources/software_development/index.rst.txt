Software Development
--------------------

The Observatory Control System (OCS) includes a Software Development Kit (SDK) to be used for the development and testing of all OCS subsystems, including GMT Device Control System (DCS) software. The SDK is built for use in the GMT Development Environment (Linux).

.. note::

   The software release and distribution mechanism changed in version 1.4. In version 1.3 and earlier, the GMT software release consisted of an ISO image containing the Fedora Operating System and relevant third-party packages , as well as a large set of RPMs containing packaged GMT software. The development environment will no longer be distributed as an ISO image, but detailed instructions will be provided to recreate an appropriate environment and for installing and configuring the GMT SDK.
