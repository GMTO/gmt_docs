Installing the SDK
==================

Development Platform
--------------------

The development platform is no longer distributed as a standalone ISO file. Instead, the following guide is provided to assist with hardware, operating system and third-party software configuration required for running the OCS SDK. Some key areas, such as disk partitioning, user authentication and NFS mounting of home directories, depend on individual factors at each partner institution and should therefore be considered examples only.

Benefits of this approach, versus distributing the complete ISO, include the ability to support different network, hardware and software platforms used for software development by different partner institutions, as well as allowing for separate upgrade schedules for the Development Platform and Software Development Kit without affecting ongoing subsystem software development.

.. note::

   At GMTO, these instructions are formalized using Kickstart files and installed via the network using tools such as Cobbler. The GMTO DevOps team can provide assistance in setting up a similar system for development at partner institutions, if required.

The Observatory Control System (OCS) is designed to be a distributed system with device control components running on real-time computers, connected to common services and user interface components via the control network. 

For device control systems, the following operating systems are supported:
    - Fedora server

For user interfaces, the following operating systems are supported:
    - MacOS

Future versions of the SDK could include support for CentOS, RHEL or Scientific Linux. Fedora has a very short release and support cycle (6 months and 18 months respectively), which is not ideal for a platform that requires significant stability over long periods of time.

Server Configuration
--------------------

Servers are used for developing, running and testing device control software and core services. When real-time communication with hardware is required, the real-time kernel should be installed and configured. The following guidelines for creating a server should be tailored according to its intended purpose. 

Required Hardware
.................

Minimum hardware requirements for development machines:

  * Intel Pentium 4 or higher, 2 GHz CPU
  * 1 GB Memory
  * 20 GB Hard drive

Typical GMT OCS development machine specs:

  * Intel Xeon E3 or higher, 3.2 GHz CPU
  * 4 - 8 GB Memory
  * 120 - 250 GB Hard drive


Operating System
................

Install the Operating System using these instructions: 

 
  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 1

     dev_environment/fedora_server


Repository Configuration
........................

Some required RPMs are built by GMTO and need to be downloaded from the GMTO Yum Repository, currently hosted on Amazon Web Services.

To add the GMT repositories:

1. Add the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/gmt.repo`` with the following content:

  .. code-block:: bash

    [gmt]
    name=GMT $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/yum/stable/$releasever/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1

2. Add the file ``/etc/yum.repos.d/gmt-updates.repo`` with the following content:

  .. code-block:: bash

    [gmt-updates]
    name=GMT $releasever - $basearch - Updates
    baseurl=http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/yum/updates/$releasever/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1

Advanced System Configuration (optional)
........................................

In a distributed computing environment, used by multiple developers, it is very convenient to use a centralized LDAP server for User Authentication and automatically mount /home directories from a network drive. The LDAP and NFS server configuration is network-dependent. The following instructions can be used as guidelines when configuring individual development machines to make use these services, if available.

  .. note::

    This configuration is currently optional. The alternative is to add users manually and manage permissions locally on each development machine.

  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 1

     dev_environment/ldap_configuration
     dev_environment/nfs_configuration

Infiniband Configuration (optional)
...................................

Infiniband is a low-latency networking communications protocol that requires specialized hardware. The following configuration steps should be used as a guide when configuring Infiniband communications.

1. Install the neccessary packages

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf install -y infiniband-diags opensm libmlx4

2. Edit ``/etc/rdma/mlx4.conf`` and add the following line:

  .. code-block:: bash

3. Find the interface used for Infiniband and edit the corresponding configuration file (for example ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ib0``) to set the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    DEVICE=ib0
    ONBOOT=yes
    TYPE=Infiniband
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=<ib_ip_address>
    NETMASK=<ib_netmask>

  where ``<ib_ip_address>`` is the static IP Address associated with the Infiniband network interface and ``<ib_netmask>`` is the netmask used for the infiniband subnet.

4. Enable Infiniband Services

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl enable opensm
    $ sudo systemctl enable rdma

Ethercat Configuration
......................

EtherCAT is a high-speed fieldbus communication system used for real-time control. The following configuration steps should be used as a guide when configuring EtherCAT communications.

1. Install the real-time kernel and relevant packages

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf install -y --nogpgcheck kernel-3.14.73-rt78.x86_64 ethercat-devel

2. Select the Ethernet interface to be used for EtherCAT communication (e.g. enp4s0) and edit the corresponding configuration file (e.g. ``/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp4s0``) to set the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    BOOTPROTO=none
    ONBOOT=no

3. Check the Hardware Address of the selected EtherCAT network interface

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ ifconfig

4. Edit ``/etc/ethercat.conf`` and set the following configuration option:

  .. code-block:: bash

    MASTER0_DEVICE="<mac_address>"

  where ``<mac_address>`` is the hardware addresses associated with the Ethercat network interface.

5. Edit ``/usr/lib/systemd/system/ethercat.service`` and uncomment the following line:

  .. code-block:: bash

    Before=network.service

6. Reboot into the RT Kernel, if you're not in it already.

7. Enable the Ethercat service

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl enable ethercat
    $ sudo systemctl start ethercat

8. Edit ``/etc/security/limits.d/99-realtime.conf`` and add the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    @realtime - rtprio 99
    @realtime - memlock unlimited

9. Add a new group and add the "gmto" user to it.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo groupadd -f -g 2001 realtime
    $ sudo usermod --groups realtime gmto

8. Test the Ethercat configuration

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ ethercat master
    $ ethercat slaves

If the "ethercat master" command does not produce the correct output, ensure that you're currently running the real-time kernel. If the "ethercat slaves" command produces no output, check that the ethernet cable is connected to the correct port as configured above.


Network Time Protocol Configuration
...................................

For general network timekeeping, use NTP, unless Precision Time Protocol is required.

1. Install the necessary packages:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf install -y chrony

2. Enable the NTP Service

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl enable chronyd


Precision Time Protocol Configuration (optional)
................................................

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dnf install -y linuxptp

2. Edit ``/etc/ptp4l.conf`` and add the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    [global]
    slaveOnly       1
    verbose         1
    time_stamping   software
    summary_interval 6
    [enp3s0]

where ``[enp3s0]`` should be set to the interface to use for PTP.

3. Edit ``/etc/sysconfig/phc2sys`` and add the following options:

  .. code-block:: bash

    OPTIONS="-a -r -u 60"

4. Edit ``/etc/sysconfig/ptp4l`` and add the following options:

6. Enable the ptp service

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo systemctl enable ptp4l


Operations Workstation Configuration
------------------------------------

The OCS User Interface needs to be run on a system with sufficient graphical rendering capability. At the moment, the Real-time kernel used for device control systems running EtherCAT does not contain the graphics modules necessary to support the user interface. It is recommended to run the user interface in a Mac, connected to the DCS via the network. Future releases will include support for Linux workstations (Fedora). 

Operating System
................

Apple Mac systems have the operating system already installed. The User Interface has been tested on the following versions of MacOS:

    - MacOS High Sierra
    - MacOS Mojave

Packages
........

There are very few external packages that are not already installed in MacOS. The application Homebrew can be used to install these:

1. Install Homebrew

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

  More information can be found on the Homebrew website: <https://brew.sh/>

2. Install common utilities

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install wget


Python Installation
...................

1. Check whether Python3 is installed

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 --version

2. Install Python3, if not already installed

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ brew install python3

Node Installation
.................

1. Check whether **Node version 8** is installed

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ node --version

2. If Node is not installed or you are using a different version of Node, install **nvm** and use it to install **Node 8**

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ touch ~/.bash_profile
    $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
    $ source ~/.bash_profile
    $ nvm install 8.12.0
    $ node --version
    v8.12.0

  More information can be found on the nvm GitHub site: <https://github.com/creationix/nvm>

Software Development Kit (SDK)
------------------------------

The Software Development Kit is distributed as a TAR file and can be downloaded from the GMTO release server.

The SDK should be installed in a **Global GMT Software Location**, defined by the GMT_GLOBAL environment variable (default value: /opt/gmt). A **Local Working Directory**, defined by the GMT_LOCAL variable, is used as a unique workspace for individual developers. The local working directory typically resides underneath the /home/<username> directory.

1. Download the latest SDK distribution:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo wget http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/releases/sdk/linux/gmt-sdk-1.5.0.tar.gz

  for the server version of the SDK, or 

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo wget http://52.52.46.32/srv/gmt/releases/sdk/macos/gmt-ui-1.5.0.tar.gz

  for the workstation version.

2. Extract the TAR file in the /opt directory, into a new folder for the latest release:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir /opt/gmt_release_1.5.0
    $ sudo tar -xzvf <gmt-tar.gz> -C /opt/gmt_release_1.5.0

  where <gmt-tar.gz> is the file downloaded in step 1.

3. Create a symbolic link from the **Global GMT Software Location** to the latest release:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo ln -sfn gmt_release_1.5.0 /opt/gmt

4. Create a **Local Working Directory**

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir <local_working_dir>

  where ``<local_working_dir>`` is in the current users' home directory, for example ~/work. The GMT software modules developed by the user are created in this folder.

5. Add the following lines to your .bash_profile (or .kshrc or .bashrc depending on your preferred shell)

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ export GMT_GLOBAL=/opt/gmt
    $ export GMT_LOCAL=<local_working_dir>
    $ source $GMT_GLOBAL/bin/gmt_env.sh

  This will ensure that the environment variables are correctly configured when opening a new terminal. Please log out and back in for the changes to take effect. To configure the environment for the current shell, run the commands manually.

6. Check the values of the environment variables:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ gmt_env

7. Install local Node Modules

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL
    $ cp $GMT_GLOBAL/package.json ./
    $ npm install

  Install global node modules for `Webpack` and `Coffeescript`.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo npm install -g coffeescript webpack webpack-cli

8. Initialize the Development Environment:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL
    $ gds init

  The correct folders will be created in the $GMT_LOCAL directory for use when compiling and running modules.  

  When running the User Interface, create a **local javascript library folder**.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir -p $GMT_LOCAL/lib/js

9. Create a **modules** directory in $GMT_LOCAL

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL
    $ mkdir modules

10. Clone the HDK and isample modules

  This step is relevant for any module that the developer will be working on. It is recommended to fork the central repository in GitHub and cloning your personal fork, instead of working with the GMTO repositories. Any modifications should be submitted through a Pull Request, to be approved and merged after peer review.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL/modules
    $ git clone https://github.com/<username>/ocs_hdk_dcs
    $ git clone https://github.com/<username>/ocs_isample_dcs

  Where <username> is your GitHub username, assuming you've forked from the GMTO repository. 

  Alternatively, use ``git clone https://github.com/GMTO/ocs_hdk_dcs`` to clone from the central repository.

11. Create the **bundles.coffee** and **ocs_local_bundle.coffee** files, defining the local modules under development 

  These files may be copied from $GMT_GLOBAL and then edited to reflect the developer's configuration.

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir $GMT_LOCAL/etc/bundles
    $ cp $GMT_GLOBAL/etc/bundles/bundles.coffee $GMT_LOCAL/etc/bundles/
    $ cp $GMT_GLOBAL/etc/bundles/ocs_local_bundle.coffee $GMT_LOCAL/etc/bundles/

  Edit **bundles.coffee** to point to the ocs_local_bundle.coffee file

  .. code-block:: bash

    module.exports =
        ocs_local_bundle:   {scope: "local",  desc: "GMT iSample and HDK bundle"}

  Edit **ocs_local_bundle.coffee** to include the isample and HDK modules, or other modules that you are working on

  .. code-block:: bash

     module.exports =
     name:      "local"
     desc:      "List of local development modules"
     elements:
         isample_dcs: { active: true, test: false, developer: 'gmto', domain: 'idcs' }
         hdk_dcs:     { active: true, test: false, developer: 'gmto', domain: 'idcs' }

12. Systems that run the User Interface require compiled model files to be used by the Navigator application.

  Build all model files from modules in your ocs_local_bundles definition using webpack. For example:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL/modules/ocs_hdk_dcs/model
    $ webpack
    $ cd $GMT_LOCAL/modules/ocs_isample_dcs/model
    $ webpack
